# "Are We There Yet?" - Parenting Book Project

## Book Concept
**Title:** "Are We There Yet? A List of Things You're Not Going to Miss About Parenting"
**Genre:** Parenting / Low-Content Book / Humor
**Core Concept:** A reverse baby book - instead of celebrating milestones, it's a humorous journal for parents to document all the things they won't miss as their children grow older, helping them cope with the bittersweet reality of kids getting older.

## Market Research & Validation Steps
1. Search Amazon for similar books in your niche
2. Check BSR (Best Seller Rank) of top competitors

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Current Market Leaders

**Traditional Baby Books (Saturated Market)**
- "Baby's First Year" memory books ($15-40 range)

- Examples: Lucy Darling's Baby's First Year, Promptly's Complete Childhood History ($39)

**Parenting Humor Books (Growing Niche)**
- "Sh*tty Mom" series
- "I Just Want to Pee Alone" (NYT Bestseller)
- "The Baby Owner's Manual" (technical humor approach)
- "This Is Ridiculous This Is Amazing" by Jason Good
- Mostly essay collections, not interactive journals

**Fill-in Journals**

### Gap #2: Interactive Cathartic Humor
- Most humor books are essay collections (passive reading)
- Few combine fill-in prompts with dark/real humor
- None offer structured "venting with purpose"

### Gap #3: Age Progression Format

- None track the evolution of parenting annoyances by stage
- Missing the "Are we there yet?" countdown element
